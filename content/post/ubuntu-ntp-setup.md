> Network Time Protocol (NTP) is a networking protocol used to synchronize the clocks of computer systems over a network. It is designed to ensure that the time displayed on all computers in a network is accurate, even if some of the computers have incorrect or outdated clock settings. NTP is particularly useful in environments where multiple computers need to coordinate their actions or share time-sensitive information, such as in a distributed database or a network of servers.

### Install NTP
The NTP daemon (`ntpd`) is included in the default Ubuntu installation, but it is not enabled by default. To set up NTP on an Ubuntu server, follow these steps:

Install the NTP package by running the following command:

```
sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install ntp
```

Edit the `/etc/ntp.conf` file to specify the NTP servers that the server should use to synchronize its clock. The NTP pool project maintains a list of publicly available NTP servers that can be used for this purpose. To use servers from the NTP pool, add the following lines to the `ntp.conf` file, replacing `region` with the two-letter code for your region (e.g. `us`, `ca`, `uk`, etc.):

```
server 0.region.pool.ntp.org
server 1.region.pool.ntp.org
server 2.region.pool.ntp.org
server 3.region.pool.ntp.org
```
Restart the NTP daemon to apply the changes:

```
sudo service ntp restart
```

That's it! The NTP daemon will now periodically synchronize the server's clock with the specified NTP servers.

### Uses for NTP

There are many ways that NTP can be used in different types of networks. Here are a few examples:

#### Enterprise networks

In an enterprise network, NTP is often used to ensure that all servers and client computers have accurate clocks. This is important for a variety of reasons, including:

- **Coordinating the actions of distributed systems**: If the clocks on different servers are not synchronized, it can be difficult or impossible for them to coordinate their actions or share information. For example, if one server thinks it is noon while another server thinks it is morning, they may not be able to agree on when certain events should take place.
- **Auditing and compliance**: Many organizations are required to maintain logs of their systems' activity for auditing or compliance purposes. If the clocks on different systems are not synchronized, it can be difficult or impossible to accurately determine the order in which events occurred.
- **Scheduling tasks**: If the clock on a server is not accurate, it may not execute scheduled tasks at the correct time. This can cause problems for systems that rely on these tasks to function properly.

#### Internet service providers

Internet service providers (ISPs) often use NTP to synchronize the clocks of their servers and other network equipment. This is important for a variety of reasons, including:

- **Network management**: Accurate clocks are essential for monitoring and managing a network.
- **Time-stamping log files**: ISPs often maintain log files of their network activity, including access logs, traffic logs, and error logs. If the clocks on different servers are not synchronized, it can be difficult or impossible to accurately determine the order in which events occurred.
- **Network security**: Accurate clocks are also important for detecting and preventing security breaches. For example, if an attacker tries to access a server using a stolen password, the server may log the attempt and block the attacker's IP address. If the server's clock is not accurate, it may be difficult to determine when the attack occurred or how long the attacker's IP address should be blocked.
- **Billing and usage tracking**: ISPs often track their customers' usage and charge them accordingly. If the clocks on different servers are not synchronized, it may be difficult to accurately determine how long a customer was connected to the network or how much data they used.

#### Web servers

Web servers often use NTP to ensure that their clocks are accurate. This is important for a variety of reasons, including:

- **Time-stamping log files**: Web servers maintain log files of their activity, including access logs, error logs, and server logs. If the clocks on different servers are not synchronized, it can be difficult or impossible to accurately determine the order in which events occurred.
- **Coordinating the actions of distributed systems**: If the clocks on different servers are not synchronized, it can be difficult or impossible for them to coordinate their actions or share information. For example, if one server thinks it is noon while another server thinks it is morning, they may not be able to agree on when certain events should take place.
- **Scheduling tasks**: If the clock on a web server is not accurate, it may not execute scheduled tasks at the correct time. This can cause problems for systems that rely on these tasks to function properly.

#### Problems that can occur if NTP is not running properly on an Ubuntu server

If NTP is not running properly on an Ubuntu server, it can cause a variety of problems, including:

- **Inaccurate clocks**: If the NTP daemon is not running or is not configured correctly, the server's clock may not be accurate. This can cause problems for any system or application that relies on accurate time information.
- **Difficulty coordinating the actions of distributed systems**: If the clocks on different servers are not synchronized, it can be difficult or impossible for them to coordinate their actions or share information.
- **Inaccurate log files**: If the clocks on different servers are not synchronized, it can be difficult or impossible to accurately determine the order in which events occurred. This can make it difficult to troubleshoot problems or audit system activity.
- **Scheduling problems**: If the clock on a server is not accurate, it may not execute scheduled tasks at the correct time. This can cause problems for systems that rely on these tasks to function properly.
